# EMOJIonal

We all get emotional, all the time. Sometimes we need a friend to give a word of encouragement, no matter what kind of emotion we are dealing with.

You are going to build an app that allows a user to tap an emoji that represents how they feel, then get a message to encourage them! The messages will be specific based on the emoji they selected.

You have full control over the UI of this app (it is truly a single screen), the emojis you pick, how many emojis the user can pick from, and the messages you provide to your user!

Here's a super plain version of what you're shooting for:
