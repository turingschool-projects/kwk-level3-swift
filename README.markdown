# KWK Level 3 (Swift/iOS) Curriculum

## Principles

We will anchor the camp around the following principles:

* Coding
* Communication
* Collaboration
* Confidence

## Understandings

* Approximately 10-20 high-school age girls will participate in the two-week camp
* In 2018 Turing staff will teach one camp and other KWK contract instructors will teach three others
* The course needs to introduce both the Swift language and the frameworks/understandings necessary to begin developing for the iOS platform
* Students participating in the camp will have completed one or more previous camps and will have some understanding of programming processes and concepts

## Success

* The planning and execution of this camp will be a success when:
  * The staff are adequately equipped to execute the camp plan faithfully
  * The students are highly engaged and excited about the technology
  * The students walk away with one project that they can show off
  * The students are equipped with professional skills to amplify their success in school and work/life
  * The students feel and demonstrate an increased confidence for challenging work

## Example of Final Project

* Viewfinder Project: https://github.com/turingschool/kwk-camera-app

## Collaboration

* If you are working on or need review of any materials, please make sure that is reflected in the appropriate table in the [sessions README](./sessions/README.markdown) so work is not overlapped.
* Slides and Lab markdowns should be inside the sessions directory, and should end with `_slides` and `_lab` respectively - when the class and lab names do match exactly, the beginning of those files names should as well.
