# Leap Year

[What is a leap year?](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/google-doodleleap-day-2016-what-is-a-leap-year-and-why-do-we-have-them-a6897486.html)

Write a program to check if a given year is leap year.

A year is leap year if following conditions are satisfied:
1) The year is a multiple of 400
2) The year is a multiple of 4
3) The year is not a multiple of 100 (except for when it's a multiple of 400)

Your function should return the boolean of `true` or `false`, answering the question "Is the year that was passed in as an argument a leap year?"
