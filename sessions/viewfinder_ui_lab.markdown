# Lab Notes: Build Your ViewFinder UI

## Learning Goals

* Students will implement their wireframes into a UI
* Students will create navigation controllers and segues


## Plan

In this lab, you will bring your wireframes to life!


### Getting Started

* On your laptop, find the Xcode application by typing `cmd + space`, typing in `xcode`, then press return
* Click `Create a new Xcode project`
* Under `Choose a template for your new project`, select `iOS`
* Under `Application`, select `Single View App`
* Click the blue `Next` button in the bottom right corner
* ‚ÄºÔ∏èYou must check the `Use Core Data` box! ‚ÄºÔ∏è
* You will be prompted to save this file. For `Product Name`, type in "______" - whatever name your want to officially title your app, then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner
* ‚ÄºÔ∏èYou must check the `Create Git respository on Mac` box! ‚ÄºÔ∏è
* NOTE: This will be your ACTUAL project! From now on, you won't really be creating new projects, just opening this one up and working from wherever you left off.


### Build Your ViewFinder UI

Similar to our StoryBoard and Actions/Outlets lessons, we will need to start with the UI, then fill in the details as we go. So today's lab is focused on getting your UI set up!


#### Expected

* Delete the ViewController from the StoryBoard scene
* Delete ViewController.swift file from the Navigation Pane (move to trash)
* On the StoryBoard, drag on a TableViewController from the Object Library
* With the TableViewController selected, click Editor --> Embed In --> Navigation Controller
  - This will embed the view inside of a Navigation Controller, which will allow us to use a back button, and other similar buttons on the top of the page
* With the Navigation Controller selected, in the Utilities Pane, select the Attributes Inspector, scroll down to the View Controller section, and check the box next to `Is Initial View Controller`

* _Run on your iPad to make sure it's working_ - you shouldn't see much; you just want to make sure there aren't any build errors.

* In the Document Outline, click on the Navigation Item (under Table View Controller). Now, look at the Attributes Inspector in the Utilities Pane, and you should see a form for Title. Write the name of your app into that field.

* Drag a `Bar Button Item` from the Object Library onto the right-side of your Navigation Bar on the Table View. This will be the button the user taps to visit the "Add New Photo" page. In the Utilities Pane, you can change the title under `Bar Item`. You can also use the drop-down menu title `System Item` to select an iOS icon.

* Drag a new `View Controller` onto your StoryBoard. `ctrl + click` then drag your `Add` button on the Table View over to your new View Controller. Select `show`. This is telling the computer, "when the user clicks on this `add` button, take them to this other view, please." This is called a `segue`.

* _Run on your iPad to make sure it's working_

* The default `back button` will list the entire app name - feel free to change that to "back" or leave as is. You change it by clicking on the home page title, then filling in the `back button` form in the Utilities Pane.

* Drag a `Navigation Item` onto the new ViewController. Change the title in the Utilities Pane to something like "Add New Photo".

* _Run on your iPad to make sure it's working_

* Add buttons for Camera, PhotoLibrary, and Albums (if all of those are in your wireframes!)
* Add in your ImageView, TextField for caption, and `Save` button. Apply constraints so it looks good on all devices.
* Insert a placeholder image in the ImageView.

* _Run on your iPad to make sure it's working_


### ‚ùóÔ∏èCommit Your Work ‚ùóÔ∏è

In Xcode, select `Source Control`, `Commit`, type in a message describing your changes (probably "Complete Build UI"), then click `Commit Files`.


#### Extension

* In your original wireframes, did you and your partner plan to have a home screen? You can add in another ViewController and change the segues. Test it out on your simulator or iPad to make 100% it's behaving the way you want it to.
* Fill in the blanks from your wireframe - add in colors, fonts, background images, etc. that make this the app you and your partner are dreaming of üí´
