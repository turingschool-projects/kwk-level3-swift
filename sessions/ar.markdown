# Augmented Reality in iOS

## What is AR?
Read [this](http://mobileedar.weebly.com/what-is-ar.html) article. After, answer the following questions:
- What is AR?
- What is the difference between AR, VR, and MR? Which one are you most excited about/interested in? Why?
- Do you use any apps that integrate AR or VR? 

## Get AR Up & Running
Read through [this blog](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-started-with-ar-in-swift-the-easy-way-7399fe1c82f5) and follow along to build a Home Decor AR app!

## Explore the ARKit
While building the Home Decor app, you used the `SCNCapsule` to create the capsule/pill, then the `SCNPlane` to create the appearance of a flat floor along the horizontal plane. What other 3D figures are available in the ARKit?

Probably in another project, try to get a different figure to appear on your app - maybe a box or sphere? If you are completely stuck, you can follow along with one (or more) of the tutorials [here](https://medium.com/@azamsharp/arkit-geometry-materials-nodes-gestures-oh-my-c4bc04e8aadf)
