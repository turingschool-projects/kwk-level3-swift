# Lab Notes: For-In Loops

## Learning Goals

* Students will explain what a for-in loop is and why they are useful
* Students will create for-in loops to repeat code
* Students will create for-in loops to iterate over an array

## Plan

During this lesson, you will practice creating and using for-in loops. You will also practice using for-in loops to iterate over arrays.

## Getting Started

* On your laptop, start the Xcode application by pressing `cmd + space` to bring up the spotlight window, typing in `xcode`, and then pressing return
* Click `Get started with a playground`
* Select 'blank', then click the blue `Next` in the bottom right corner
* You will be prompted to save this file. The default name is `MyPlayground` - let's change that to "For-In Loops", then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner

### For-In Loops

Sometimes we want to create code that will repeat for a specific number of times. Imagine making pancakes. There's a lot of repetitive tasks! Pour the batter, wait, flip the pancake, wait, re-butter the pan, amd then repeat the process until you have a delicious stack ready for some syrup. It would be great if we could just tell a robot, "Make twelve pancakes!" In code, we can actually write a for-in loop - which is just a bit of code that will do whatever we tell it to do, however many times we want.

#### Expected

* Write a for-in loop that prints `Hello` to the console five times
* Write a for-in loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5 to the console
* Iterate over an array using a for-in loop:
  - Create an array of the names of five of your friends
  - Write a for-in loop that uses each name and prints `Hello, [friend's name]` to the console
* Iterate over a dictionary using these directions:
  - Create a dictionary where the keys are names of cities, and the values hold the distance between that city and your location (you'll need to do some research! You choose the cities!)
  - Write a for-in loop that uses each city and distance and prints `You are currently ___ miles away from _____`.

#### Extension

Can you use the for-in loop to edit the strings in your friends array from just their names to their names plus an exclamation point? Consider:

- how to access an element in an array based on its index
- how to tell your for-in loop to run for the same number of times as the length of your array
- how to assign a new value to an element in an array
- how to add strings together

Don't forget to write down your notes so you can remember and share them later!

## Circle Back

Let's take some time to answer the following questions in our journals, and then discuss our answers together.

- What is a for-in loop (in Swift)? What does it do?
- What are the different ways you can use a for-in loop?
- How can for-in loops be useful? What do you think is the point of them?
- Can you brainstorm some ways that one of your favorite apps might make use of a for-in loop?
