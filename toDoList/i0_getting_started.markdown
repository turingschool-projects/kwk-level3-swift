# ToDo List - Iteration 0

## What we're building

This is a really cool ToDo List application that has never been built before üôÑüòõü§ó. You can create a new ToDo, indicate if it is important, and delete it from your list once you have completed it. Genius!

## Getting Started

* Create a new Xcode project (iOS, Single View App)
* Make sure **USE CORE DATA** is selected
* Head over to Main.storyboard and delete the existing View Controller 
* From the Navigation Pane, delete the ViewController.swift file associated with that View Controller (Move to Trash)

## Adding and Designing a TableView

* From the Object Library, add a Table View Controller to the Storyboard
* With the Table View Controller selected in the Storyboard, embed it in a Navigation Controller (select this option from Editor)

This should have added a Navigation Controller to the Storyboard and added a Navigation Item to our Table View Controller. We now want to make sure that this is our point of entry for our ToDo List application. 

* With the Navigational Controller selected, make sure `Is Initial View Controller` is checked in the Attributes Inspector

If we select the Navigation Item in the Table View Controller, we can now add a Title to our app (ToDo List or whatever you prefer)

We now want to add a Bar Button Item that will take us to another View to add a ToDo. You can customize this however you like.

Great! Let's connect this Table View to some code!

* Create a ToDoTableViewController file (File -> New -> File... -> Cocoa Touch Class -> Next). 

Don't forget to make this a subclass of UITableViewController and connect it to the TableViewController on your storyboard!

## Create a custom ToDo class

* Create a new file (File -> New -> File... -> Swift File -> Next) and name it `ToDo` (this will create a ToDo.swift file in our project)
* Delete `import Foundation` and add `import UIKIt`
* Create a ToDo class that has 2 instance variables/properties... `name` and `important` - if you need a refresher on how to create a class and add instance variables, take a look back at [this lesson](https://github.com/ameseee/kwk-level3-swift/blob/master/sessions/classes_objects_slides.markdown)

It probably makes sense to initialize `name` to an *empty string* and `important` to the boolean *false*. And that's all we need to do for our ToDo class!!!

## Create some ToDos

* Back in our ToDoTableViewController, we need to make a function that will create toDos and return an array of toDos (we'll hard code this for now and replace it a little later when we hook up CoreData)

```swift
func createToDos() -> [ToDo] {
        
  let swift = ToDo()
  swift.name = "Learn Swift"
  swift.important = true
  
  let dog = ToDo()
  dog.name = "Walk the Dog"
  // important is set to false by default
  
  return [swift, dog]
}
```
* We also need to create a toDos property on our ToDoTableViewController class (above our viewDidLoad func)

```swift
var toDos : [ToDo] = []
```

* Inside `func viewDidLoad()`, delete all the commented out code and reassign toDos to our createToDos function (now toDos will be the array of toDos we returned from the function)

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()

  toDos = createToDos()
}
```

Let's clean this file up a little more. You can delete all the other functions in this file **except** the `tableView` function with `numberOfRowsInSection`, the `tableView` function with `cellForRowAt`, and the last `prepare` function that has to do with segue navigation (you can leave this commented out for now).

* In the `tableView` function with the argument `numberOfRowsInSection`, we want to return toDos.count

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  return toDos.count
}
```

* In the `tableView` function with the argument `cellForRowAt`, we want to copy the string **reuseIdentifier**
* Now go back to the Storyboard and click right under Prototype Cells to highlight the Table View Cell
* In the Attributes Inspector, paste **reuseIdentifier** into the `Identifier` field
* Now inside that same `tableView` function, we need to access a single toDo

```swift 
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
  let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "reuseIdentifier", for: indexPath)

  let toDo = toDos[indexPath.row]

  return cell
}
```

* Now let's add some code to get our toDos to show up and to indicate if the toDo has been marked important

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
  let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "reuseIdentifier", for: indexPath)
  
  let toDo = toDos[indexPath.row]
  
  if toDo.important {
    cell.textLabel?.text = "‚ùóÔ∏è" + toDo.name
  } else {
    cell.textLabel?.text = toDo.name
  }
  
  return cell
}
```

**BOOM!** You should now be able see our hard-coded toDos in the Table View when you run the application!
